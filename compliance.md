# Compliance Mapping (Illustrative)

Layer 1 supports organizational requirements in common frameworks:

---

## NIST 800-53

Relevant controls:
- AC-1, AC-3, AC-6: Access control
- PL-2, PM-9: Security program & governance
- SC-7: Boundary enforcement
- CA-7: Continuous monitoring

---

## ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A

Matching themes:
- A.5.1–A.5.4: Information security governance
- A.5.15–A.5.16: Access control & identity governance
- A.8.20, A.8.21: Network controls
- A.5.7: Security policy

---

## CIS Controls

- CIS Control 4: Secure configuration
- CIS Control 5: Identity and access management
- CIS Control 13: Network monitoring

---

## Intent of this Mapping

This layer does not provide full compliance but **supports the foundation** for it by defining:
- Org-wide segmentation
- Mandatory guardrails
- Policy enforcement
- Cloud hierarchy and scope

Formal compliance requires:
- Risk processes
- Assessments
- Identity governance
- Monitoring
